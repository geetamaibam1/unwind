                <h2>Perfect South of France</h2>

                <p>
                    The South of France is simply perfection. It is a destination that truly entices your senses. Hints of lavender and handmade soap fill the air, tastes of cheeses and jams at the market delight the tastebuds, and even the views of hilltop villages and sun-drenched beaches will leave you breathless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the best way to experience it is with a South of France road trip itinerary!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re currently planning a trip to the South of France, you’ve probably realized by now that this area of the world has SO much to offer. This definitely makes creating a plan for 7 days in Provence tricky. 
                </p>
                <h2>What is Provence?</h2>
                <p>
                    You’ve likely noticed above that I have used both “South of France” and “Provence” interchangeably. Well, Provence, or Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, is a region in the southeast of France well-known for its Mediterranean beaches and lavender fields. 
                </p>
                <h3>Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur</h3>
                <p>
                    Now, to break it down further, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur is made up of 6 departments, which are administrative departments. These include Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Hautes-Alpes, Alpes-Maritimes, Bouches-du-Rhône, Var, and Vaucluse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this Southern France itinerary, we’ll be visiting Vaucluse, Bouches-du-Rhône, and Alpes-Maritimes departments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will note that what is considered “Provence” doesn’t actually include the Côte d’Azur (the coast along the Mediterranean). Typical Provence actually includes places like Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, the villages of the Luberon, Valensole, etc.
                </p>
                <h3>Towns and Cities that Comprise Côte d’Azur</h3>
                <p>
                    While these places are all within the region called Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, they are very different culturally, historically, and topographically. However, in this South of France itinerary, you’re going to see a mix of both!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ever beautiful Nice</li>
                        <li>The never-fails-amaze Marseille</li>
                        <li>The amazing Cassisv Antibes, Eze, Grasse, St Tropez, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>From charming villages to a chilled-out beach day, let’s talk about how to have the best South of France Itinerary in 7 days! </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Avignon and Châteauneuf-du-Pape</li>

                <h2>Google Gemini Is Coming to Android</h2>
                <p>March 9, 2025 by <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none authorsLink" >Jacob</a></p>
                <p>
                    Generative AI in a vehicle would be a great addition. It should provide more complete answers to questions, more effectively guide you to gas, food, or safety, tell you not only what is wrong with your car but what you should do to limit the damage, and keep you entertained on long trips where you are very likely to fall asleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the AI has to be properly trained, performant, and not annoying. Right now, Gemini in Android Auto is none of those things. Thus, it shouldn’t be seen in the light of day because it is creating negative impressions that could eventually kill this effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hate to see Android Auto AI go the way of Google Glass, but it doesn’t look like Google has yet learned from past mistakes. Let’s hope Google corrects its path, as I’d really like a working AI to chat with while I drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what caught my eye, particularly as I think about how AI could be used in driving, was the BYD/DJI (DJI is the biggest Chinese drone company) and their effort to wed a drone with their SUV line.

                <h2>Health is Wealth</h2>
                <p>March 9, 2025 by <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none authorsLink" >Chris</a></p>
                <p>
                    The saying "health is wealth" isn't just a cliché; it's a powerful reminder that your physical and mental well-being is the most valuable asset you possess, far exceeding any material possession you could accumulate. When you prioritize your health, you unlock the potential to live a fulfilling life, enjoy experiences to the fullest, and be productive in all aspects of your life - something no amount of money can guarantee. 
                </p>
                <p>Why Health is Truly Wealth:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased Energy Levels</li>
                        <li>Mental Clarity and Focus</li>
                        <li>Reduced Healthcare Costs</li>
                        <li>Stronger Relationships</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that your health is not something you can simply buy; it's a choice you make every day. By prioritizing your well-being, you are investing in a richer, more fulfilling life - the true meaning of "health is wealth"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you have any habits or routines that help you prioritize your health? It's time to think about it.
